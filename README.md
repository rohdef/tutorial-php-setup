# Tutorial PHP setup

One of my friends recently asked me how to setup a PHP project
properly.  I understand why she was puzzled, because she have learned
a lot of good techniques for development, and are suddenly faced with
a community that... well leaves a lot to be desired.

This is part of a guide to get - well I guess I cannot say sanity but
then - less insanity in a PHP project. PHP is hugely flawed in many
ways.  That said a lot can be done for PHP by doing it right, and
despite the huge amount of flaws in the design of PHP most of the
issue comes from really bad habits among PHP developers.

Development is more than just slamming working code together, it is
the architecture, good design principle, the framework around one's
development and so on.

This strives to approach the surrounding framework, so one can get a
proper setup to get one started.  That is, basically trying to answer
my friends question, and hopefully putting some useful knowledge to
the PHP community to counter those bad habits.

## Att. recruiters/headhunters/etc

I will not do PHP profesionally unless forced to.  Do you have Java
development, Android, C++ etc. feel free to reach out, but please
spare me for your PHP positions.
